Step 01: Define parameters to represent ROCK, SCISSORS and PAPER. (done)
Step 02: Define parameters to represent your current score and the AI's current score.
Step 03: Write a method named "printMenu" that prints the menu. (You can customize the method to 
         print anything you want.) The following is an example menu:

         Welcome to the game of Scissors Paper Stone!
         Enter 1 to play and 2 to exit.

Step 04: Write a method named "getInput" that returns the next integer keyed in by the user.
Step 05: Write a method named "compareShapes" that takes in 2 shapes and return the results.
         The method should take in 2 arguments, being "aiChoice" and "userChoice". If the AI wins,
         return -1. If the user wins, return 1. If it is a tie, return 0.
Step 06: Write a method named "checkValidShape" that takes in a single argument and check that it 
         belongs to either ROCK, SCISSORS or PAPER.
Step 07: Write a method named "newRound" that does the following:
         1. Print the scores of the user and the AI.
         2. Let the AI decide on what shape to use later.
         3. Print a menu to let the user select ROCK, SCISSORS or PAPER.
         4. Check that the user's choice is valid.
            4a. If the user's choice is invalid, get the user to choose again.
         5. Compare the user's choice with the AI's choice to see who wins the round.
         6. Print the AI's choice.
         7. Print the result of the round.
         8. Update the scores.
Step 08: Combine the code in the "main" method.
